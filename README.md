Project (ICC02_P9) **Desarrollo fullstack de soluciones web con JavaScript y servicios web**

## INTRODUCTION :rocket:
***
"__Tic Tac Toe__" Game, developed with JavaScript, using REST api and Mongoose

## USER GUIDE :clipboard:
***
To use the application first you've got to start the app running node

Once we have entered the application, it will ask to register or to login, selecting a room and an a player avatar.


When you click on the play button, the application shows the game window, where we can see the alphabet soup and on the right a column with the words to find


When we find a word, we position ourselves with the mouse on the first letter of the word and by pressing the right mouse button we will drag until all the letters that compose it are selected, while the selection is made, the letters are shown in orange

At the end of the selection, if done correctly, the word will turn blue and will be crossed out from the right column

If you find all of them, the board appears with a green background and the words found highlighted in white

Once all the words have been found, we press the solve button, a table with the scores will appear
